
Functions and Methods Homework
Complete the following questions:

1.Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.

def vol(rad):
    return ((4/3)*(3.14)*(rad**3))



2.Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)


def ran_check(num, low, high):
    if num in list(range(low, high+1)):
        print (num,"is in the range beween",low,"and",high)
    else:
        print (num,"is NOT in the range beween",low,"and",high)



3.Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33

HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()

If you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!


def up_low(s):
    
    up_list = 0
    low_list = 0

    for char in s:
        if (char.isupper()) == True:
            up_list += 1
        elif (char.islower()) == True:
            low_list += 1

    print ("No. of upper case characters:", up_list)
    print ("No. of lower case characters:", low_list)




4. 
Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

Sample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


def unique_list(lst):
    new_list = []
    for num in lst:
        if num not in new_list:
            new_list.append(num)
    new_list.sort()
    return new_list


5. 
Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

Sample List : [1, 2, 3, -4]
Expected Output : -24

def multiply(numbers):
    total = 1
    for num in numbers:
        total = (num * total)
    return total


6. 
Write a Python function that checks whether a passed in string is palindrome or not.

Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.


7. 
Hard:
Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.

Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Hint: Look at the string module

import string

def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
    
    str1_list = list(set(str1.lower()))
    str1_list.sort()
    str1_list = str1_list[1:]
    if str1_list == alphabet:
        return True
    else:
        return False
