LEVEL 1 PROBLEMS
OLD MACDONALD: Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name
old_macdonald('macdonald') --> MacDonald


def old_macdonald(text):

    first_letter = text[0]
    inbetween = text[1:3]
    fourth_letter = text[3]
    rest = text[4:]

    return first_letter.upper() + inbetween + fourth_letter.upper() + rest


#Better


def old_macdonald(text):

    first_half = text[:3]
    second_half = text[3:]

    return first_half.capitalize() + second_half.capitalize()




MASTER YODA: Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed
master_yoda('I am home') --> 'home am I'
master_yoda('We are ready') --> 'ready are We'


def master_yoda(text):
    text = text.split()
    text_list = list(text)
    rev_list = text_list[::-1]
    rev_string = " ".join(rev_list)
    print (rev_string)



ALMOST THERE: Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200
almost_there(90) --> True
almost_there(104) --> True
almost_there(150) --> False
almost_there(209) --> True


def almost_there(n):
    if n >= 90 and n <= 110 or n >= 190 and n <= 210:
        return True
    

#Better?:

def almost_there(n):
    return (abs(100-n) <=10) or (abs(200-n) <= 10)
