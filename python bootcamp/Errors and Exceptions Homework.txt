Problem 3
Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it. Use a while loop with a try, except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.

 
def ask():
    while True:
        
        my_int = int(input("Please enter a number to find the square: "))
        
        try: 
            print ("Thank you, the square is: ", my_int**2)
            break
        except:
            print ("That's not a number! Try again! \n")
            continue
        else:
